8.5 MW biomass at Balaji Ispat Pvt limited
Balaji Ispat Private Limited has set up 8.5 MW Biomass based Power Project By Balaji Ispat Private Limited Village : Belsonda, Tehsil & District : Mahasamund of Chhattisgarh state of india. 
This is Greenfield project. 
The project was commissioned in 23-Dec 2006 .

The purpose of the project is the construction and operation of a grid connected electricity generation unit using biomass (rice husk, and paddy straw). The biomass project generation facility will involve installation of a 40 TPH nominal capacity Circulating Fluidized Bed Combustion Boiler. The boiler and the turbo-generator are installed with the necessary auxiliary plants and systems required for the efficient operation of the biomass based power plant.

The proposed project shall use the conventional combustion and steam-power cycle. The pressure and temperature chosen are at 67 Kg/ Sq. cm. and 480 Deg. C respectively. The pressure and temperature are less than more efficient rankine cycle plants (operating at 87 Kg/Cm2 or 105 Kg/Cm2). This lower pressure technology has been chosen to facilitate the use of biomass. will compensate for lower efficiency as well as lower Plant Load Factor (PLF) of the plant compared to normal coal fired power plants. 

Hence, project activity is displacing the estimated annual net electricity generation i.e., 56961.9MWh from the Indian grid system, which otherwise would have been generated by the operation of fossil fuel-based grid-connected power plants. The project activity doesnâ€™t involve any GHG emission sources. The estimated annual CO2e emission reductions by the project activity are expected to be 51265.71 tCO2e, whereas actual emission reduction achieved during the first CoU period shall be submitted as a part of first monitoring and verification. 

Since the project activity will generate electricity through biomass energy, a clean renewable energy source, it will not cause any negative impact on the environment and thereby contributes to climate change mitigation efforts.
